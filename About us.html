<h3>To be the leader in the cinema exhibition industry, in every aspect, right from the quality and choice of cinema to the varied services offered and eventually the highest market share.</h3>

    <p>As one of India’s top multiplex chains, INOX operates 746 screens in 173 multiplexes across 74 cities of India. The entertainment venture of the renowned INOX Group, the company started its journey in 2002 from its 1st multiplex in Bund Gardens Pune and now entertains 70 million guests across the country annually. In the process, INOX has set high benchmarks of ‘Luxury’, ‘Service’ and ‘Technology’ in the cinema exhibition industry. Thriving on innovativeness, INOX has pioneered plenty of ‘firsts’ in the industry. INOX operates Megaplex at the Inorbit Mall Malad, Mumbai - a multiplex with highest number of cinema viewing experiences in the world. The Megaplex is also home to India’s first ScreenX as well as India’s first screen with MX4D® Theater Effects. INOX was the 1st cinema chain in the country to operate a Laserplex, a multiplex with all the screens enabled with Laser Projection. With the grand and immersive IMAX screens already a part of its repertoire, INOX also has Mumbai’s first Samsung ONYX LED screen at the Megaplex. INOX’s 7-star cinema viewing experience, INSIGNIA, has emerged as a top luxury proposition in the country. INOX’s desire to offer tailor-made experiences to its patrons has led to the creation of home-grown formats like the vibrant and lively KIDDLES for the young audience, the smart luxury experience CLUB for the discerning guests, and BIGPIX a premium giant screen cinema format. INOX also maintains a sharp focus on F&B and architectural design to stay ahead on the ‘Experience’ curve. INOX has curated a lot of F&B concepts, cuisines and menu options. INOX’s focus is on developing captivating architectural designs to make the multiplexes look aspirational and also complete the ‘Experience’ promise. Driven by its passion to improvise unremittingly and deliver moments which may be treasured by patrons, INOX is committed towards operating a sustainable, responsible, and profitable business venture and attain new levels of operational brilliance.</p>
